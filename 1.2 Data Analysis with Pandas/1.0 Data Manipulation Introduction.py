# When asked about Google's model for success, Peter Norvig, the director
# of research at Google, famously stated,

# "We don't have better algorithms than anyone else; we just have more data."

# Though probably an understatement (given the amount of talent employed at
# Google), the quote does provide a sense of just how vital data is to
# having successful outcomes.

# People normally discuss the importance of data in the context of machine
# learning. No matter how sophisticated a machine learning model is, it
# will not perform well unless it has a reasonable amount of data to train
# on. On the other hand, given a large and diverse set of training data,
# a good deep learning model will significantly outperform non-deep
# learning algorithms.

# However, data is not just limited to machine learning. Companies use data
# to identify customer trends, political parties use data to determine
# which demographics they should target, sports teams use data to analyze
# players, etc.

# The universal usage of data makes data processing, the act of converting
# raw data into a meaningful form, an essential skill to have.

# Many scenarios involve mostly numeric datasets. For example, medical data
# contains many numeric metrics, such as height, weight, and blood
# pressure. Furthermore, the majority of neural networks use input data
# that is either numeric or has been converted to a numeric form.

# When we deal with numeric data, the best Python library to use is NumPy.
# The NumPy library allows us to perform many operations on numeric data,
# and convert the data to more usable forms.
